## Setup

1. Create virtual environment:
```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
```

2. Activate virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

1. Explore the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory
2. Check out example implementations in `src/models/`
3. Run tests using `pytest tests/`

## Learning Path

1. Data Preprocessing and EDA
2. Basic ML Algorithms
3. Model Evaluation
4. Feature Engineering
5. Advanced ML Techniques
